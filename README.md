# MD-32X-RAM-Cart

A 4MiB RAM cart design for the Sega Genesis/Megadrive and the 32X.

![img](https://github.com/viciious/MD-32X-RAM-Cart/blob/master/4m_cy62167e_x2.png)

Currently only works as MD RAM cart as reading data from the 32X causes data corruption.

Based on the original design by Tiido.
