# ROM Loader for the Mega 32X RAM Cart

This project shows an example of how to load files onto the 4MiB RAM cart. 

## Description

Make sure the lower switch on the cart is set to "boot off the CD" position. Write the ISO file of this project to a CD-R and boot using the SegaCD addon.

After initial loading, the program will list files it was able to find on the CD. Select a ROM file from the CD and press A to write it onto the RAM cart. Pressing B will verify ROM/RAM contents with the selected file.

To boot off the previously written ROM, you need to toggle the lower switch to the off position and power cycle the console. Pressing the RESET button on the console will not work!
